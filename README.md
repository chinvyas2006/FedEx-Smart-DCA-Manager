# FedEx-Smart-DCA-Manager
An AI-powered, automated platform for centralized Debt Collection Agency (DCA) management, recovery prediction, and governance.

🚀 The Problem

Current DCA management at FedEx is fragmented and manual, relying on Excel and emails. This leads to delayed recoveries, limited visibility, and weak governance.




💡 Our Solution

We propose an intelligent, centralized platform that:

Centralizes Allocation: Moves away from Excel to automated case distribution.

AI-Driven Prioritization: Uses ML models to predict recovery probability and prioritize high-value accounts.

Automated Workflows: Enforces SOPs and SLAs through low-code automation.

Real-time Analytics: Provides dashboards for performance tracking and recovery predictability.




🛠️ Tech Stack

AI/ML: Python (Scikit-learn/TensorFlow) for recovery prediction.


Automation: RPA for legacy system data extraction.


Backend: Node.js/Python (FastAPI) for secure, role-based portals.


Frontend: React/Next.js for real-time dashboards.




📈 Expected Impact

Efficiency: Reduced overdue aging and faster feedback loops.



Governance: Full audit trails and clear ownership for every case.



Scalability: A secure, future-ready architecture for increasing volumes.
